r9	2011-02-12	Computes only half of the matrix (computational savings of 45% in test case)
				No more crashes upon building all the connects
r8	2011-02-11	This is the first version that 'works'. It selects a list of
					towns, weighs them based on distance and populaiton, and
					then builds connections. However, it can be VERY slow and
					crashes once everything is connected!
				Requires RoadPathfinder, v.3
				RemoveExistingConnections(WmAtlas)
				BuildRoad(path)

Roadmap:
- improve 'remove existing routes' by limiting the search space to only road tiles
- move array functions to library
- improve route selection by estimating cost based on building cost rather than pure distance
- move to grid based route finding
	- generate 'gateways' for each town
	- do route finding one grid spacing at a 
- rewrite build path sequence so I can call it my own
- figure out how to get the version number to show up in Start()
- somehow include towns that are connected but would benefit from a shorter connection
- check the town centres are actually roads (use AIRoad::IsRoadTile() )
- lisence - http://opensource.org/licenses/qtpl ?
